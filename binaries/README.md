# Espruingo Binaries
These have been cross compiled using the Gox tool. Binaries included for Mac, Linux and Windows - both 32-bit and 64-bit. There's also Arm binary for Raspberry Pi

You should be able to use these without installing Go.

Only Windows 32 bit tested (on Win 7). It does not work as well as the Mac version to be honest. Issues include not exiting on disconnecting the Espruino, error handling not as solid. It does monitor your file, load it to espruino and echo to the console. 

I don't know if you could get better results by building your own binary on your host operating system. 

Please note - I'm not responsible if these things eat your computer! Use at your own risk or build your own.
